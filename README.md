Stanley's dotfiles.
========

My .files from Ubuntu. Files will be updated over time, these are intial files after I started using Ubuntu more often.
Most inspiration is from [Thread "Show us your .bashrc!"](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=679762 "Show us your .bashrc!"),[mathiasbynens dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles "dotfiles") and [paulirish dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles "dotfiles").

If you have any good sites with tips and tricks for dotfiles, let me now. Thanks.
